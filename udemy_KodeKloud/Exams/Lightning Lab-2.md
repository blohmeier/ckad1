We have deployed a few pods in this cluster in various namespaces. Inspect them and identify the pod which is not in a Ready state. Troubleshoot and fix the issue.
Next, add a check to restart the container on the same pod if the command ls /var/www/html/file_check fails. This check should start after a delay of 10 seconds and run every 60 seconds.

Create a cronjob called dice that runs every one minute. Use the Pod template located at /root/throw-a-dice. The image throw-dice randomly returns a value between 1 and 6. The result of 6 is considered success and all others are failure.
The job should be non-parallel and complete the task once. Use a backoffLimit of 25. 
If the task is not completed within 20 seconds the job should fail and pods should be terminated.

Create a pod called my-busybox in the dev2406 namespace using the busybox image. The container should be called secret and should sleep for 3600 seconds. 
The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret.
Make sure that the pod is scheduled on controlplane and no other node in the cluster.

Create a single ingress resource called ingress-vh-routing. The resource should route HTTP traffic to multiple hostnames as specified below:
The service video-service should be accessible on http://watch.ecom-store.com:30093/video.
The service apparels-service should be accessible on http://apparels.ecom-store.com:30093/wear.
